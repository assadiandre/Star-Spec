# Star Spec

**About:**
This is the first game I ever officially published. It took me about 4 months to create. I programmed the app in Corona SDK. It had an in game currency, in app purchases, multiple spaceships, achievements, and many obstacles.

**To Run:**
- Download Corona SDK
- Locate the main.lua file
- Right-click on the main.lua file > open with > Corona SDK
