# Star Spec

**Star Spec** is a game I developed in 2017 using Corona SDK. It received 5,000+ downloads. Star Spec included multiple power-ups, achievements, in-app purchases, nice visuals, physics, in-game currency and more. The purpose of the game was to collect as many coins as possible while dodging asteroids.

**To Run:**
- Download Corona SDK
- Locate the main.lua file
- Right-click on the main.lua file > open with > Corona SDK
- Please note: This app has been removed from the app-store since 2018. You can see a website visual [here](https://appadvice.com/app/star-spec/1185775000).
