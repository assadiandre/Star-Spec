# Star Spec

**Star Spec** is a game I developed in 2017 using Corona SDK. It received 5,000+ downloads. Star Spec included multiple power-ups, achievements, in-app purchases, nice visuals, physics, in-game currency and more. The purpose of the game was to collect as many coins as possible while dodging asteroids.

**To Run:**
