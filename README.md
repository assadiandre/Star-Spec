# Star Spec

**Note**
My first game ever. It involved spaceships and was published to the appstore. This game took me about 4 months to create. I programmed the app in Corona SDK. It had an in game currency, in app purchases, multiple spaceships, achievements, and many obstacles.

**To Run:**
- Download Corona SDK
- Locate the main.lua file
- Right-click on the main.lua file > open with > Corona SDK

- Please note: This app has been removed from the app-store since 2018
