# Star-Spec
My first game ever. It involved spaceships and was published to the appstore.

**Note**
This game took me about 4 months to create. I programmed the app in Corona SDK. Star Spec was very difficult to make. It had an in game currency, in app purchases, multiple spaceships, achievements, and many obstacles.
